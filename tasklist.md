- DESIGN UI PAGES FOR MOBILE

- refactoring
- support search and filters on backend (state=, status=, starter=, today=true, viewports=[])
- support groupby=scenario for jobs history
- store approves in history
- Think out different using scenarios for different persons: The Developer, The TeamLead, The Indie
- Loading a lot of images through AuthProxy is hard? Need to return signed link to S3 instead
- Do not use Login as userId, because it uses in path building and could allow user chang directories, use user UID instead
- Run scenarios with overrode parameters (hostname/resolutions/...)
- Cookies callback/field, or before run script
- Get scenario approved images
- Collect analytics: % of passed this day/week, passed % by week
- Show the latest run image at ScenarioCards: "Store or Query" latestRun, approved and latestRunDiff (if has) of scenario
- Retry Policy for backend-db, backend-queue
- Add ScenarioHistory collection [scenarioRef/Name, date, status, historyRecordRef, successRate(calc) ]
- AuthGuard to redirect unauthorized users to login page ASAP
- Remove all References and test Files on removing Scenarios or Viewports
- Remove test result Files and Report after remove history record
- Auth proxy should not store passwords in plain text
- Auth proxy - change password
- Sanitize body and params in Auth proxy & Backend
- Angular: MultiLanguage support
- Restrict number of viewports
- Show Difference value, to get user knowledge for tuning test sensivity 
- Bulk add scenarios (urls)
- Page Modification/Disable Animation option for scenario
- API for run-with-parameters by config from body + APIKEY
- Unapprove: Review and turn back any previously approved results.
- Locate tiny changes, and mark them more noticably
- Use user-friendly dates (by moment)
- Think out understanding of costs (weight of s3/lambdas/queues/vm in total cost of user) to work out correct pricing strategy


- Display retry button for not-ready yet history record (screens)
- Confirmation dialog for delete ops
- Layout for results/history
- Show stats, chart and measure stability
- Displaying Errors on load and save


- DOCKERIZE AUTH-PROXY & BACKEND AND RUN THEM IN AWS
- AWS LAMBDA
- AWS SQS
- CLOUD MONGODB
- TELEGRAM BOT
- SLACK BOT
- SCHEDULER FOR RUNS
- LANDING PAGE (WP/Gatsby/Hugo/Jekyll/Shopify?)
- PAYMENT & TRIAL-ACCOUNTS
- COMPARE WITH COMPETITORS: diffy.website, screenster.io, percy.io
    - ON DEMAND AGENT (MANAGED BY SERVER) TO MAKE SCREENSHOTS (WITHOUT AUTH/OF LOCALHOST) AND SEND THEM TO THE BACKEND
    - GITHUB/CIRCLECI INTEGRATION like DIFFY, AutoSearch links to other pages
- Tenant support (Tenant > Users + Scenarios + Results + Jobs)
- Project support (Tenant > Projects > Users + Scenarios + Results + Jobs). One project is a buch of scenarios.
- (?) Refactoring Mode: Make change > Test > Approve Differences to Stage if no side-effects > Repeat > Ehe all done, Approve to Master
