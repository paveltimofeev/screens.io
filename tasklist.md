- Use Master term instead of Reference?
- **------------ MVP MILESTONE ------------**
- Backend: Hide internal path to the "not found ref image", in case of error when Ref not exists
- Backend: Scenarios Page Actions - Run anf Remove scenarios filtered by ids[]*viewports[]
- [Bug] Scenario fails after rename. Because of changed ref path, as scenario label is a part of path.

- Frontend: Animate processes - approve button should be animated during approve process, run during run and other microinteractions.
- Run Scenario(s) by Id, not by label, because different project should be able to have the same label sometimes.

- Backend: resize images for ui cards (sm, md, lg) - only one viewport size, no matter do it for every viewport size.
- [Costs] Backend: Do not store test result image if test i passed, because there is no difference with reference.
- [Costs] ability to quickly close new user registration (to protect from overbudget)
- Add limit or paging to all jobs requests (like getScenarioHistory, no need to load all 1000k records straight away)
